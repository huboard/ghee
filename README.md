Testing
-------

The test suite uses [VCR](https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr) to cache actual requests to the Github API in a directory called responses in the spec directory.

In order for VCR to make and cache the actual calls to the Github API you will need to copy spec/settings.yml.sample to spec/settings.yml and configure it with your GitHub username, either a GitHub access token or your GitHub password, a test repo for it to hit against (which you should setup ahead of time), and finally an organization you belong to (for the entire suite of tests to pass you have to belong to an org).

This file is ignored by git (see .gitignore) so you can commit any changes you make to the gem without having to worry about your user/token/pass/org being released into the wild.

Now run the test suite:

    bundle
    bundle exec rake

CONTRIBUTE
----------

If you'd like to hack on Ghee, start by forking the repo on GitHub:

https://github.com/jonmagic/ghee

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
1. Hack away
1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `bundle exec rake`
1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
1. Do not change the version number, we will do that on our end
1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
1. Push the branch up to GitHub
1. Send a pull request for your branch
